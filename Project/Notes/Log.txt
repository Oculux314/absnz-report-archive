27 Jan    Introuctory meeting, project assigned.

28 Jan    Data is 'by student' rather than 'by school' - more data requested.

31 Jan    Created timing and structure plans. Structure significantly deviates from 2016 report to be more structured.
          Qualifications by year now has its own section rather than being part of every other section.
          Assessment format data no longer available.
          All other data and main categories preserved.

04 Feb    Official offer to create report accepted.

09 Feb    Programming began.

15 Feb    Report formatting set.

16 Feb    Data manipulation: (Prim.Co-Ed, Sec.Girls) --> (Single Sex), (Sen.Co-Ed, Jun.Boys) --> (Co-Ed), Unknown excluded.
          Note: males who attended female single-sex schools are included, females who attended male single-sex schools are excluded.
          Rationale: student sex is the only way to filter for boys in co-ed schools and this filter should be matched for single-sex schools to avoid bias.
          Downloaded MATLAB plugin: plotBarStackGroups (https://au.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/32884-plot-groups-of-stacked-bars). License in MATLAB folder. Modified.
          
19 Feb    Completed data manipulation programming aspect.
          Downloaded 'AyoQujzf3EEq8G.jfif' from https://sway.office.com/LiQKXrnES1ezq9Kl?ref=Link for colour scheme. Colours are:
            White   #ffffff
            Yellow  #fe8b2e
            Blue    #2190be
            Red     #f02538 (text)
            Purple  #1b1d4d (background)
            
20 Feb    Graphing functions complete excluding table formatting.
          First graphs generated.
          Data validation required.
          Note: label order cannot be changed.
          Sample graph produced and sent.

21 Feb    Sample graph approved.

27 Feb    'By school' data refused by Education Counts - instructed to proceed with 'by student' data.

05 Mar    Overview handling code completed.
          Tables now export ready-to-paste.
          All assets ready.
          
07 Mar    Report writeup began.
          Provisional sections:
            Introduction
            Overview
            Disaggregated by Year
            Disaggregated by Quintile
            Disaggregated by Ethnicity

12 Mar    Performed data validation. Failed: sigma values were not accounted for.
          It appears that to save file space, Education Counts has aggregated identical rows into the same row, then added a 'sigma value' to record how many rows were aggregated.
          Sigma issue patched.
          Performed data validation. Passed: matches Education Counts graphs.
          Introduction complete, excluding summary.
          
14 Mar    Progress report sent to ROG.
          Reply recieved.

15 Mar    Made decision to invert bar stack order from [UE (base) --> No Qual (top)] to [No Qual (base) --> UE (top)]
            Decision rationale:
              - New order aligns with table order to avoid confusion
              - New order allows the total no. school leavers who attained a qualification to be shown
                (not just how many attained that as their highest qualification)
            Note that MATLAB forces the legend entry order to be opposite bar stack order and this cannot be changed.
          Fixed bug: using ethnicity datasets in quintile table/figure calculations.
          Implemented printing n values.
          Created definitions subcategory.
          Finished Overview section draft.
          Imported tables/figures into report document, with captions.
          
16 Mar    Sent copy of report writeup to ROG.
          Reply recieved -> implemented feedback.
          
20 Mar    Progress report - intent to finish by Mon 27 Mar in time for review.
          Note that coming week is busy.
